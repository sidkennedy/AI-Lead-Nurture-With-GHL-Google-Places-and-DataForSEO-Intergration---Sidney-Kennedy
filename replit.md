# Powered Up AI — Project Notes

## What This Is

GHL-integrated AI sales assistant for audiology practices. Node/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, Claude (claude-sonnet) for AI, GHL webhooks for contact management.

Admin dashboard lives at `/admin?key=YOUR_ADMIN_KEY`.

## Dev Mode (Local UI Testing)

### What it does
Setting `DEV_MODE=true` in your local environment puts the server into a safe testing mode:
- **Scheduler is disabled** — no automatic follow-up jobs fire from your local instance. Production keeps running normally.
- **GHL sends are stubbed** — no real SMS or emails go out, no matter what you click. The console logs what *would* have been sent.
- **Dev banner shows** — a bright orange bar across the top of the admin dashboard confirms you're in dev mode.
- **Real data is visible** — you're reading from the production database, so all contacts, stats, and conversations are real.

### How to enable it locally
Add this line to your `.env` file (the one in the project root, never committed):
```
DEV_MODE=true
```
Then restart the workflow. You'll see a box in the console confirming dev mode is active.

**Never set `DEV_MODE=true` in the Replit Secrets/deployment environment.** It should only exist in your local `.env`.

### What you can safely do in dev mode
- Design and test any admin UI changes
- Add new panels, graphs, stats
- Test AI prompt changes (Claude is called, response is shown in console, but nothing sends)
- Click any admin button without risk

### Preview pane
The Replit preview pane (`/`) redirects directly to `/admin`. Add `?key=YOUR_ADMIN_KEY` to the URL and bookmark it.

## Architecture

- `server.js` — all API endpoints, admin dashboard HTML/JS/CSS
- `ghl.js` — GHL API wrapper (sendMessage, sendEmail, fetchContact, fetchContactsByTag)
- `conversations.js` — in-memory + DB contact state (contactMap)
- `followups.js` — job scheduler, silence checks, hook/nurture sends
- `brain.js` — stats, variant analytics, outbound/inbound recording
- `prompts.js` — DB-backed prompt storage, variant picking (A/B/C)
- `enrollment.js` — AI-powered conversation history analysis for re-enrollment
- `spend.js` — per-contact Claude API spend tracking
- `optouts.js` — opt-out keyword detection and blocklist

## Database
Single PostgreSQL database shared between local dev and production. `DATABASE_URL` env var. Tables include: `contacts`, `brain_messages`, `winning_patterns`, `funnel_snapshots`, `followup_jobs`, `prompts`.

## Key Environment Variables
- `ADMIN_KEY` — protects all `/admin/*` routes and API endpoints
- `GHL_API_KEY` — GHL API access
- `GHL_LOCATION_ID` — GHL location identifier
- `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — (optional) validates incoming GHL webhook signatures
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Claude API access
- `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string
- `DEV_MODE` — set to `true` locally only to enable safe dev mode
